<h4>Reading 1 <a id="/bible/isaiah/7:10|" href="http://www.usccb.org/bible/isaiah/7:10">Is 7:10-14</a>
</h4>
<div class="poetry">
The LORD spoke to Ahaz:<br>Ask for a sign from the LORD, your God;<br>let it be deep as the nether world, or high as the sky!<br>But Ahaz answered,<br>"I will not ask! I will not tempt the LORD!" <br>Then Isaiah said:<br>Listen, O house of David! <br>Is it not enough for you to weary men,<br>must you also weary my God? <br>Therefore the Lord himself will give you this sign:<br>the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,<br>and shall name him Emmanuel.<br>

R.

In the sixth month,<br>the angel Gabriel was sent from God<br>to a town of Galilee called Nazareth,<br>to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph,<br>of the house of David,<br>and the virgin's name was Mary.<br>And coming to her, he said,<br>"Hail, full of grace! The Lord is with you."<br>But she was greatly troubled at what was said<br>and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.<br>Then the angel said to her,<br>"Do not be afraid, Mary,<br>for you have found favor with God.<br>Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son,<br>and you shall name him Jesus.<br>He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High,<br>and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father,<br>and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever,<br>and of his Kingdom there will be no end."<br><br>But Mary said to the angel,<br>"How can this be,<br>since I have no relations with a man?"<br>And the angel said to her in reply,<br>"The Holy Spirit will come upon you,<br>and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.<br>Therefore the child to be born<br>will be called holy, the Son of God.<br>And behold, Elizabeth, your relative,<br>has also conceived a son in her old age,<br>and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren;<br>for nothing will be impossible for God."<br><br>Mary said, "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord.<br>May it be done to me according to your word."<br>Then the angel departed from her.<br>

The angel awaits an answer; it is time for him to return to God who sent him. We too are waiting, O Lady, for your word of compassion; the sentence of condemnation weighs heavily upon us.</p><p>The price of our salvation is offered to you. We shall be set free at once if you consent. In the eternal Word of God we all came to be, and behold, we die. In your brief response we are to be remade in order to be recalled to life.</p><p>Tearful Adam with his sorrowing family begs this of you, O loving Virgin, in their exile from Paradise. Abraham begs it, David begs it. All the other holy patriarchs, your ancestors, ask it of you, as they dwell in the country of the shadow of death. This is what the whole earth waits for, prostrate at your feet. It is right in doing so, for on your word depends comfort for the wretched, ransom for the captive, freedom for the condemned, indeed, salvation for all the sons of Adam, the whole of your race.</p><p>Answer quickly, O Virgin. Reply in haste to the angel, or rather through the angel to the Lord. Answer with a word, receive the Word of God. Speak your own word, conceive the divine Word. Breathe a passing word, embrace the eternal Word.</p><p>Why do you delay, why are you afraid? Believe, give praise, and receive. Let humility be bold, let modesty be confident. This is no time for virginal simplicity to forget prudence. In this matter alone, O prudent Virgin, do not fear to be presumptuous. Though modest silence is pleasing, dutiful speech is now more necessary. Open your heart to faith, O blessed Virgin, your lips to praise, your womb to the Creator. See, the desired of all nations is at your door, knocking to enter. If he should pass by because of your delay, in sorrow you would begin to seek him afresh, the One whom your soul loves. Arise, hasten, open. Arise in faith, hasten in devotion, open in praise and thanksgiving. <em>Behold the handmaid of the Lord,</em> she says, <em>be it done to me according to your word.</em></p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">RESPONSORY </span> See Luke 1:31,42</p><p>Receive, O Virgin Mary, the word<br /> which the Lord has made known to you by the message of the angel:<br /> You will conceive and give birth to a son, both God and man,<br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8212;</span> and you will be called blessed among women.</p><p>A virgin, you will indeed bear a son;<br /> ever chaste and holy, you will be the mother of our Savior.<br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8212;</span> And you will be called blessed among women.</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">CONCLUDING PRAYER</span></p><p>O God,<br /> eternal majesty, whose ineffable Word<br /> the immaculate Virgin received<br /> through the message of an Angel,<br /> and so became the dwelling-place of divinity,<br /> filled with the light of the Holy Spirit,<br /> grant, we pray, that by her example,<br /> we may in humility hold fast to your will.<br /> Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,<br /> who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br /> one God, for ever and ever.<br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8212;</span> Amen.</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">ACCLAMATION</span> (only added when praying in community)</p><p>Let us praise the Lord.<br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8212;</span> And give him thanks.</p> <!-- ICEL COPYRIGHT NOTICE --><div id="icel"><span class="icel">The English translation of The Liturgy of the Hours (Four Volumes) &copy;1974, <a href="http://www.icelweb.org/" target="_blank">International Commission on English in the Liturgy Corporation</a>.
