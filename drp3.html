<div class="poetry">
Beloved:<br />The way we may be sure that we know Jesus <br />is to keep his commandments. <br />Whoever says, "I know him," but does not keep his commandments<br />is a liar, and the truth is not in him.<br />But whoever keeps his word,<br />the love of God is truly perfected in him. <br />This is the way we may know that we are in union with him:<br />whoever claims to abide in him ought to walk just as he walked.<br /><br />Beloved, I am writing no new commandment to you<br />but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. <br />The old commandment is the word that you have heard. <br />And yet I do write a new commandment to you,<br />which holds true in him and among you,<br />for the darkness is passing away,<br />and the true light is already shining. <br />Whoever says he is in the light,<br />yet hates his brother, is still in the darkness. <br />Whoever loves his brother remains in the light,<br />and there is nothing in him to cause a fall. <br />Whoever hates his brother is in darkness;<br />he walks in darkness<br />and does not know where he is going<br />because the darkness has blinded his eyes.<br />

<p dir="ltr">When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;Every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the Lord&rdquo;), and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord&rsquo;s Messiah.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the law, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,&ldquo;Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">And the child&rsquo;s father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, &ldquo;This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed&mdash;and a sword will pierce your own soul too.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">After blessing Mary and Joseph, Simeon speaks directly to Mary: &#8220;Sorrow, like a sharp sword, will break your heart.&#8221; The little family then returned to their hometown of Nazareth where &#8220;the Child grew and became strong&#8230;full of wisdom&#8230;with God&#8217;s blessing upon him.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">These events are enriched by many biblical themes going back centuries. &nbsp;To join our own prayer to that of this unique company is both a challenge and an invitation. &nbsp;The future can never be the same for us, for Emmanuel is truly with us, now and forever.</p>

As another Thomas (St. Thomas More) put it who defied another Henry (Henry VIII) some centuries later, he died “the king’s good servant, but God’s first.” Here is another all-too-relevant example of someone willing to bear the price of fidelity to his faith.</p><p>Merry Fifth Day of Christmas!<br /> We love you all.</p> <!-- ICEL COPYRIGHT NOTICE --><div id="icel"><span class="icel">The English translation of The Liturgy of the Hours (Four Volumes) &copy;1974, <a href="http://www.icelweb.org/" target="_blank">International Commission on English in the Liturgy Corporation</a>.

Before the Son of God became man his goodness was hidden, for God’s mercy is eternal, but how could such goodness be recognized? It was promised, but it was not experienced, and as a result few believed in it. <em>Often and in many ways the Lord used to speak through the prophets.</em> Among other things, God said: <em>I think thoughts of peace and not of affliction.</em> But what did men respond, thinking thoughts of affliction and knowing nothing of peace? They said: <em>Peace, peace, there is no peace.</em> This response made the <em>angels of peace weep bitterly,</em> saying: <em>Lord, who has believed our message?</em> But now men believe because they see with their own eyes, and because <em>God’s testimony has now become even more credible.</em> He has gone so far as to <em>pitch his tent in the sun</em> so even the dimmest eyes see him.</p><p>Notice that peace is not promised but sent to us; it is no longer deferred, it is given; peace is not prophesied but achieved. It is as if God the Father sent upon the earth a purse full of his mercy. This purse was burst open during the Lord’s passion to pour forth its hidden contents &#8211; the price of our redemption. It was only a small purse, but it was very full. As the Scriptures tell us: <em>A little child has been given to us, but in him dwells all the fullness of the divine nature.</em> The fullness of time brought with it the fullness of divinity. God’s Son came in the flesh so that mortal men could see and recognize God’s kindness. When God reveals his humanity, his goodness cannot possibly remain hidden. To show his kindness what more could he do beyond taking my human form? My humanity, I say, not Adam’s &#8211; that is, not such as he had before his fall.</p><p>How could he have shown his mercy more clearly than by taking on himself our condition? For our sake the Word of God became as grass. What better proof could he have given of his love? Scripture says: <em>Lord, what is man that you are mindful of him; why does your heart go out to him?</em> The incarnation teaches us how much God cares for us and what he thinks and feels about us. We should stop thinking of our own sufferings and remember what he has suffered. Let us think of all the Lord has done for us, and then we shall realize how his goodness appears through his humanity. The lesser he became through his human nature the greater was his goodness; the more he lowered himself for me, the dearer he is to me. <em>The goodness and humanity of God our Savior have appeared,</em> says the Apostle. Truly great and manifest are the goodness and humanity of God. He has given us a most wonderful proof of his goodness by adding humanity to his own divine nature.</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">RESPONSORY </span> Ephesians 1:5, Romans 8:29</p><p>From all eternity, God destined us in Jesus Christ to be his children by adoption,<br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8212;</span> for it was his loving purpose to show in us the glory of his grace.</p><p>Long ago he knew us and chose to make us in the likeness of his own Son.<br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8212;</span> For it was his loving purpose to show in us the glory of his grace.</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">TE DEUM</span></p><p>You are God: we praise you;<br /> You are the Lord: we acclaim you;<br /> You are the eternal Father:<br /> All creation worships you.</p><p>To you all angels, all the powers of heaven,<br /> Cherubim and Seraphim, sing in endless praise:<br /> Holy, holy, holy, Lord, God of power and might,<br /> heaven and earth are full of your glory.</p><p>The glorious company of apostles praise you.<br /> The noble fellowship of prophets praise you.<br /> The white-robed army of martyrs praise you.</p><p>Throughout the world the holy Church acclaims you:<br /> Father, of majesty unbounded,<br /> your true and only Son, worthy of all worship,<br /> and the Holy Spirit, advocate and guide.</p><p>You, Christ, are the King of glory,<br /> the eternal Son of the Father.</p><p>When you became man to set us free<br /> you did not spurn the Virgin&#8217;s womb.</p><p>You overcame the sting of death,<br /> and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.</p><p>You are seated at God&#8217;s right hand in glory.<br /> We believe that you will come, and be our judge.</p><p>Come then, Lord, and help your people,<br /> bought with the price of your own blood,<br /> and bring us with your saints<br /> to glory everlasting.</p><p>Save your people, Lord, and bless your inheritance.<br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8212;</span> Govern and uphold them now and always.</p><p>Day by day we bless you.<br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8212;</span> We praise your name for ever.</p><p>Keep us today, Lord, from all sin.<br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8212;</span> Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy.</p><p>Lord, show us your love and mercy,<br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8212;</span> for we have put our trust in you.</p><p>In you, Lord, is our hope:<br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8212;</span> And we shall never hope in vain.</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">CONCLUDING PRAYER</span></p><p>Almighty and invisible God,<br /> who dispersed the darkness of the world<br /> by the coming of your light,<br /> look, we pray, with serene countenance upon us,<br /> that we may acclaim with fitting praise<br /> the greatness of the Nativity of your Only Begotten Son.<br /> Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,<br /> one God, forever and ever.<br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8212;</span> Amen.</p><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">ACCLAMATION</span> (only added when praying in community)</p><p>Let us praise the Lord.<br /> <span style="color: #ff0000;">&#8212;</span> And give him thanks.</p> <!-- ICEL COPYRIGHT NOTICE --><div id="icel"><span class="icel">The English translation of The Liturgy of the Hours (Four Volumes) &copy;1974, <a href="http://www.icelweb.org/" target="_blank">International Commission on English in the Liturgy Corporation</a>.
